Title: Useful genetic tool allowing to discriminate individuals by comparing the distribution of their phenotype and to map the genetic loci responsible for specific distributions
Description: This package contains functions that are used to map single-cell Probabilistic Trait Loci (scPTL). The principle of scPTL mapping is to consider a distribution of single-cell traits as the phenotype of a (multicellular) individual, to acquire this phenotype in many individuals, and to scan the genome for DNA variants that change this phenotype.
